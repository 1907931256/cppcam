Binary installs only require the presence of Qt shared libraries (DLLs) with OpenGL support.

Installing from source requires Qt development package (with OpenGL support) to be installed on your computer.

To compile for Windows, install the following download: qt-opensource-windows-x86-mingw48_opengl-5.2.1.exe

Be sure to enable the installation of mingw (the gcc compiler), and add these to your enviroment:

	set PATH=C:\Qt\Qt5.2.1\5.2.1\mingw48_32\bin;C:\Qt\Qt5.2.1\Tools\Mingw48_32\bin;%PATH%
	set QMAKESPEC=C:/Qt/Qt5.2.1/5.2.1/mingw48_32/mkspecs/win32-g++

BTW, this also works on linux, with some not too vintage Wine (http://www.winehq.org/)
